/**
 * purgeSession — deep module that wipes ALL session-related on-disk artifacts
 * for a single project directory.
 *
 * Why a deep module instead of an inline handler:
 *   - The previous inline ctx_purge handler was 100+ lines split across three
 *     try/catch blocks. Only ONE of those blocks knew about the case-fold
 *     migration's dual-hash legacy filenames, so a partial upgrade could
 *     leak orphaned events.md / .cleanup files on macOS / Windows.
 *   - Centralizing the logic here means: one canonical sidecar list, one
 *     uniform dual-hash sweep, one place to add new file kinds.
 *
 * Worktree separation guarantee (carried over from the case-fold migration):
 *   Every path this module touches is derived deterministically from the input
 *   `projectDir`. There is NO `readdirSync` + glob-filter loop. Different
 *   worktrees → different physical paths → different canonical hashes →
 *   different file names → cannot collapse worktrees on disk.
 *
 * SQLite sidecar handling:
 *   Each `.db` file may be accompanied by `-wal` (write-ahead log) and `-shm`
 *   (shared memory index) sidecars. We unlink the triple unconditionally —
 *   missing sidecars are not an error. This matches the canonical SQLite
 *   sidecar naming used elsewhere (see refs/platforms/zed/crates/sqlez:
 *   `[main, "{main}-wal", "{main}-shm"]`).
 *
 * Cross-platform notes:
 *   - All paths are joined via `node:path.join` so Windows backslash
 *     separators and POSIX forward slashes both work.
 *   - On macOS / Windows (case-insensitive FS) we sweep BOTH the canonical
 *     (lowercased) and legacy (raw-cased) project-dir hash variants for the
 *     session-related kinds. On Linux the two hashes coincide, so the dual
 *     sweep collapses into a single unique-path pass.
